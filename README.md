This analysis is based on the Divvy case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman (found here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study). 

Divvy is a Chicago-based bike-share program that features nearly 6,000 bicycles and more than 600 docking stations.

Divvy's bike-sharing data is publicly accessible here: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

The purpose of this script is to consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single dataframe and then conduct simple analysis to help answer the key question: “In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?”

The insights from the analysis will be used to inform marketing efforts aimed at converting casual riders into members.
